Hi there 👋, my username is EpossDev, or simply Eposs, I love making websites, games,... in fact everything you can do with a computer. 💻

🚀 My first [website](https://epossdev.github.io/misterx) is online, it is used to play a game in real fife, so unfortunately you can't use it personally.</br>
🎲 I also made a [web app](https://epossdev.github.io/random) used to choose a random element, a name for example.</br>
🔭 I'm currently working on a [new update](https://epossdev.github.io/misterx/beta) of my first [website](https://epossdev.github.io/misterx), it's the biggest update I've ever made and it will be amazing. Are you ready ? 👀
